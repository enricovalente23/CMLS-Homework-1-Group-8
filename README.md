Implementation of a classifier able to predict the musical genre of a music piece.


GTZAN is simply a collection of songs, divided in subfolders depending on the assigned genre.
It includes 1000 songs for 10 genres at 22050 Hz sampling rate.

Depending on the group, you will need to classify only 4 genres among the 10 available in the dataset.
These are: **Classical, Disco, Jazz, Country**.
  
The results of the classification must be reported as a confusion matrix and, optionally, other metrics of your choice.
